# Sort Manager

#Overview:

This project allowes user to generate a randomised array of ints and descides the how many numbers they want to generate.
The Sort Manager also gives the option of sorting the generated numbers using the following four sorting algorithms:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Binary Tree Sort
3. Merge Sort
4. Quick Sort

Moreover, this project provides details about the time spent in sorting the randomly generated numbers based on the chosen type of sorting algorithms.

## Instructions to run

1. To use this project on InelliJ, you can run the programm through the green play button.

2. Once starting the programm, you will be asked through the console to choose one of the four sorting algorithms mentioned above.
      
3. You will then be asked about how many numbers you wish to generate. You can also type the number through the console.

4. The programm will finally sort your generated numbers and present them to you before and after the sorting oporation. You can also see through the console your chosen sorting algorithm and the time spent in sorting your numbers.

in the console with the time taken for t 
   the sort, It will also display the array before and after the sort.
