Overview:

This project allows the user to generate a randomised array of ints and decides how many numbers they wish to generate.
The Sort Manager also gives the option of sorting the generated numbers using the following four sorting algorithms:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Binary Tree Sort
3. Merge Sort
4. Quick Sort

Moreover, this project provides details about the time spent sorting the randomly generated numbers based on the chosen type of sorting algorithms.

## Instructions to Run the Programm

1. To use this project on InelliJ, you can run the programme through the green play button.

2. Once starting the programme, you will be asked through the console to choose one of the four sorting algorithms mentioned above.
      
3. You will then be asked about how many numbers you wish to generate. You can also type the number through the console.

4. The programme will finally sort your generated numbers and present them to you before and after the sorting operation. You can also see through the console your chosen sorting algorithm and the time spent in sorting your numbers.
